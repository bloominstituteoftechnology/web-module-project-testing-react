//Tasks
//1. Complete a test that shows the Episode component renders. Pass in the provided example episode data as a test prop.
//2. Modify the test data to display a specific summary statement. Complete a test that shows that the summary value passed in to the Episode component displays as expected. Use no more then 3 different expect statements to test the the existance of the summary value.
//3. The episode component displays a default value ('./stranger_things.png') when a image url is not provided. Create a new piece of test data with the image property set to null. Test that the alt tag of the image displayed is set to './stranger_things.png'.
